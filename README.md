# HopSearch

_`Comma+Period` to jump to the search box in a jiffy!_

Twitter, Google Search and a few others have it, but, possibly, your favorite website doesn't allow you to use a key-combo to jump to the search field.

## What is it? :confused:

HopSearch is a Chrome **browser extension** that allows you to use the key-combo `Comma+Period` to jump to the search input box on any page. Ofcourse, the extension doesn't know-it-all and hence requires your help in discovering new pages, which, again, is just a _click_ away.

## How to use it? :wrench:

_Coming to the Chome Web Store soon ... !_

<!-- If you're here, you're probably not going to install it via the Chrome Extensions store but, hey, that's the easiest way to go. -->

As of now, head over to [releases](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/hopsearch-extension/releases) and pick up the latest you can find. Once done, hit `Alt+H` to fire up the extension _(and maybe ... pin it?)_.

## Features _(as FAQs)_ :gem:

### How to make it work for _this_ website? 

- Open your [favorite website](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/)
- `AltH` or click on the extension button in the Chrome toolbar
- Click on _Find Search Box_
- Click on the search input field on the website
- You should now see an alert stating that the config has been saved

Try `Comma+Period` and you should find the cursor at the search box.

### It's officious, how do I stop it?

It could be meddlesome while typing with heavy shortcuts, I understand. Just `Alt+H` or click on the extension button zin the Chrome toolbar and then click on _Pause_.

### Tell me a nice shortcut!

Pausing the extension on a certain page is as easy as it sounds. Just `Alt+H` to open the extension popup and tap _spacebar_ to pause on this page. Repeat the same process to resume. :smile:

## Issues :rage:

### `Alt+H` does nothing

Is this website supported by the extension? If you `Alt+H` or click on the extension button in the Chrome toolbar, if under _Search Box Finder_ you see the words _"Not Found"_ then you need to [make it work](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/hopsearch-extension#how-to-make-it-work-for-this-website) for this website as explained above.

If you don't see the words _"Not Found"_, maybe a page refresh should fix it.

### Extension always shows a _Paused_ status

Maybe you just updated the extension at `chrome://extensions` so refreshing the page you're on should help.

## Contributing :pencil:

As I said in the first section, this extension ain't a know-it-all and I require _your_ help in extending it to websites I've not visited before. It helps other users who would visit the same website in the future.

Once you've [made it work]((https://github.com/theGeekyLad/hopsearch-extension#how-to-make-it-work-for-this-website)) for an undiscovered page, in features, check out this [short contributing guide](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/hopsearch-extension/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap :blue_car:

- Background auto-sync for downloading new configuration to be added

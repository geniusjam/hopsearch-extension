# Contributing

If you're here, you most likely clicked the _"Help improve this extension!"_ hyperlink inside the extension which tenably means you're using the extension! Thanks for that, means a lot.

Regardless of how you got here, welcome to the contributing guide! Since the extension isn't bundled with the configuration for, if not all, even most of the websites as I'm the only developer working on it, this section expounds on how to contribute configuration for _new_ websites that _you_ discover down the line.

## What's a configuration?

If you've used the in-extension search-box finder to locate the search-box of a website that the extension didn't know of, you've just added new _configuration_ and _discovered_ a website. Pat yourself on your back!

## Why contribute?

Contributing helps make the world a better place by exposing the websites _you_ discover to everyone else that's using this extension. Maybe a website you visit today and add configuration to _(by finding the search-box)_, would make it easy for me down the line. :rocket:

## I'm in! Lets go

- `Alt+H` or click on the HopSearch button in the Chrome toolbar
- Click **Copy Configuration**
- [Edit the configuration](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/hopsearch-extension/edit/master/config.json) and just `Ctrl+V` or paste and replace whatever's in that file
- Give your changes a title! In the _Propose changes_ section type-in something like _"Added new websites"_ or even _"My cool changes!"_
- Click **Propose changes**

As of now, since the project is quite inchoate, I'd review and merge your changes as and when I find them coming in.

Thanks for the will to contribute! :heart:
